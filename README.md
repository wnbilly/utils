# Utils

This repository is meant to host and share somme tools that I coded.

There are 2 folders :
- ### Slurm
  - Slurm script templates (simple job and job arrays) featuring execution time, conda virtual environment activation and clean logs.
  - Slurm utils to put in .bashrc to make the use of Slurm easier.
- ### Robotics
  - Simple stuff coded for the ENSTA Paris Robotics Club.

Feel free to use and modify the code as you wish.
